          This phrase is inspired by Walter Elias Disney.  While he was famous
          for many amazing feats, those who knew him also know he was famous for
          failing in a big way and then picking himself up and starting again. 
          If you worked for Walt, you knew when the project was coming together,
          He'd be looking for ways to, "Plus It" and make it even better.  


          It is with this philosophy in mind I work with companies both large
          and small as we find the ways to Plus It in their business.  From real
          problems, to just making a good product even better, I bring years of
          creative problem solving to my consulting work.  Whatever industry,
          whatever the situation, I can be part of the solution!  Learn more

          I don't write frequently enough to consider myself a "blogger"
          although, I do write from time to time and post what I've written for
          your consideration.  Some are from personal experiences, a few from my
          time as a paramedic and policeman.


          I'm still working on moving all of my posts over to the new page.  In
          the meantime, you can find the old version of my work [right
          here](http://thadtorix.com/blog).
