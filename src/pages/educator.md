Thad began his career in rural Hazelton, Idaho in 1994 in the EMS industry before moving to Southwest Missouri in the late 1990s.

Currently, you may find Thad spending time with his family on the rivers near Joplin, Missouri, motorcycling, or taking care of their fresh and saltwater aquariums.

Over the last twenty years, Thad has served as an EMT, Advanced EMT, Paramedic, Flight Paramedic, Emergency Dispatcher and a defensive tactics instructor trainer.

Taking particular pride in helping others find the “WIIFM” (What’s In It For Me?), Thad enjoys presenting material in a way that not only makes sense, but is useful in their every day lives.

With a passion for provider safety & emotional health, Thad enjoys speaking with first responders and health care professionals about their well-being, liability, and the ever growing problems of violence, suicide, and emotional health.  Target audiences include first responders, EMTs, paramedics, fire department/rescue personnel, nurses, medical technicians, managers, administrators, and physicians.

You may read a 2016 article published about Thad & his work on page 18 of the May edition of Joplin Globe’s J-Mag located at the bottom of this page, or go directly to the article by clicking here. Although happy to speak on most any topic in or relevant to EMS, Thad particularly enjoys addressing audiences on the following topics:

**Just Wait for EMS** – First Responder training for Police Officers, focusing on emergencies that require action before EMS arrival.

**Who’s Got The Button** – EVERYONE has buttons, like anything else, we must prepare for those encounters where ours get pushed.

**Tears of Our Own** – Emotional Health of Emergency Providers

**Toxic/Chronic Care** – Humanism in Emergency Medicine

**And Then She Died** – What the deaths of patients, colleagues, and a student can teach us.

**Curves to Consider** – Oxygen Dissociation Curve & Capnography; How they’re connected and why we should care.

**An Rx for Scenes** – How examining the first five minutes of EMS scenes can improve patient satisfaction, provider safety, interaction with colleagues and scene time.
