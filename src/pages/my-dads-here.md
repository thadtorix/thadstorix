<p>Back in 2005, I had the joy of watching our children perform their parts in the annual Christmas program at church. I also helped keep watch over the smallest of the children, mostly pre-schoolers. Most of these two dozen or so kids were just about as restless as they could be, including my youngest daughter. They were picture perfect, trying to remember the words to the music and finding parents &amp; grandparents to wave at consumed most of their time. Except for one small boy.</p>
<p>For the sake of privacy, we’ll call him Jack. Now the difference between Jack and the others was simple. He knew exactly where his Daddy was sitting, and he couldn’t wait to tell anyone who would listen, “My Dad is here!”</p>
<p>Without a doubt, that one fact was exactly what brought a smile to Jack’s face.</p>
<p>Jack had his costume… My Dad is here! He had his lines… My Dad is here! He’d practiced for hours, days, for this night… My Dad is here! The whole church is watching… My Dad is HERE!</p>
<p>If he told me once, he told me a dozen times. His dad was there. That’s what counted. That’s the only thing he needed to know to produce a smile from ear to ear.</p>
<p>Oh what we can learn from our children! You see, Jack’s smile, his joy, came from one simple reality: His Father was present. It had nothing to do with what had been given or withheld. It was not dependent on how good or bad Jack’s day had gone. The fact that Jack’s father chose to be there, at that moment, was exactly what Jack needed.</p>
<p>My Father is here. With you right now, wherever you sit reading this, the same God who spoke this world into existence has chosen to be with you. This truth is not dependent on our desires, or our actions. Even if you don’t believe it, God is here. On our best day, our worst day, and all the days in between, our Father is here to watch us. If we’ll only take a moment to look, to listen, we’ll see his signature all over our lives.</p>
<p>The very fact that he chose to create us is, by itself, very humbling. The idea that he takes personal interest in each of our lives is beyond our ability to understand. But, whether we understand it or not, He is here, paying close attention. Crying when we cry, applauding when we manage to get things right, and earnestly waiting for the end when our role on this stage called Earth is over and we sprint into His arms.</p>
<p>Can you imagine anything more powerful, more encouraging, than the presence of God? Even the most tremendous of our trials are dwarfed when viewed in the light of our Creator! Perhaps the only thing more impressive than his might and power over our problems is the un-ending grace and love He offers us. Despite our sin, our ugliness, our hatefulness, and our failures, God is still here, full of love for His children.</p>
<p>There is more to the story. During the program I saw Jack’s dad. Already proud of his son, when I told him how Jack had been proclaiming his father’s presence, he was moved to tears. There is just no replacement for the praise of your children.</p>
<p>When was the last time you proclaimed your Father’s presence? How long has it been since you just sat still and appreciated your Heavenly Father? You don’t need a costume. You don’t need rehearsed lines. Tell him whatever you'd like to. He's here, and He's listening.</p>

<p>Just a few months ago I ran into this family again. Like all of us, they've had their struggles. Actually, we all have struggles - this family has had all out battles that have threatened to split them completely. It was nice to see them again, all together doing the things that families do. Little Jack was still smiling from ear to ear.... After all, his Father was there.</p>
