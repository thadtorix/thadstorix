**Thad was amazing, he went above and beyond on our wonderful but hectic day!**

Thad is an amazing person, first of all. We had him officiate our wedding and couldnt have been happier. From the time we asked him to do so he was committed to being there for us. From messages, to texts just to check in to see how I was doing and being the bride i was obviously very stressed! ðŸ˜‚ We lost our venue about 5 weeks before our wedding so we had to hunt for a new one. Now only did Thad give is comfort but he also went out of his way to help us reach out to venues and people he knew to try and help us find a new venue. 

We thankfully found one, and once wedding week came he checked in with us several times. We met up and grabbed some coffee and chatted about how we wanted the day to go and he was very professional but also very calming. My now husband even said after we left that he felt so much better about everything just from our little meeting. 

On the day of our wedding Thad met with us (separately) and our friends and families to pray with us and just give us any pieces of wisdom or comfort. He helped us make the wedding day flow and was there to give us kind words when we needed it. 

Both of our families loved him as do we! I cannot recommend him enough to you on your wedding day. He went above and beyond to help, and give you a peace of mind on a hectic but wonderful day. Seriously. We cannot thank him enough!

Couldnâ€™t have picked anyone better!

Thad and his wife Courtney were so wonderful to work with for the wedding! They made the process very smooth and easy from start to finish. He really made a point to check in with both my husband and I throughout the whole process and made my family feel very involved! Highly recommend to anyone looking!

Thad is a true wordsmith and as genuine as they come.

Thad did an amazing job officiating our wedding. He made last minute accommodations and was sincere and helpful throughout the process. He never judged our quirky desires and went above and beyond in making us feel not only special, but important to him. I cannot recommend this man enough!

Sincere, personalized, professional, PERFECTION.

Thad provided a very personalized and sincere wedding ceremony that fit our needs! He was able to come to our rehearsal dinner and help coordinate our hectic wedding party during rehearsal. Months leading up to the wedding Thad checked in on both me and my husband to ensure we had every need met for our wedding. I have had many friends, family, and even our wedding coordinator compliment on how amazing That was! Our ceremony was unlike any other ceremony I have seen-you could tell Thad truly catered a unique and intimate ceremony. I cannot recommend Thad enough, he is amazing.
