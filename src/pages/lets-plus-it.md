This phrase is inspired by Walter Elias Disney. While he was famous for many amazing feats, those who knew him also know he was famous for failing in a big way and then picking himself up and starting again. If you worked for Walt, you knew when the project was coming together, He'd be looking for ways to, "Plus It" and make it even better.

It is with this philosophy in mind I work with companies both large and small as we find the ways to Plus It in their business. From real problems, to just making a good product even better, I bring years of creative problem solving to my consulting work. Whatever industry, whatever the situation, I can be part of the solution!

The first steps are to seek understanding.  I'll spend a day or more walking in your shoes, and in the shoes of those you are working with and for, to gain clarity with realistic perspective. If we are to tackle any situation, we must seek first to understand precisely what is taking place **before** we even begin to look for solutions.  This includes a look at what is taking place right now, and how we got here.  

Next, it's time to have some **real talk**.  What is the real goal?  What are the real underlying issues and do we truly understand them?  Are we **brave enough** to make adjustments in our core before we ask others to do the same?

**Now let's get to work.**  What changes are we making?  How will they be measured and is everyone on board, not only with the changes but how those changes will be measured?  

**Re-Assess**.  How is our progress, are we on track or do more adjustments need to be made?

**\---------------------------------------------------**

**This list of topics** is just a sampling of a handful of the philosophies and truths I lean on as I help you achieve your goals:

**Systems First**. Many times, we find what looks like a person or a behavior problem.  We change the person, but the problem persists.  What if it isn't a person problem at all?  

**People are Amazing.**  Yes, all of them.  When working with people is in our job duties, this can be easy to forget.  

**Turnover Tunnel-vision** - How, and why, we so frequently miss the real reasons behind a high turnover rate in any industry.

**Perspective Shift** - When and How you know it is time to adjust your team's perspective.

**Let's Get Past It** - Sometimes life deals us a tough season. Too often, we choose to spend more time in it than we should.

**Moments of Truth** - A look at the moments that really shape us and why it is too easy to miss the mark.

**Real Goals** - You have set goals for yourself and for your team, but have you missed the most important ones?

**Mindset Matters, but Does It Really? -** A hard look at mindset for those of us who are a little reluctant to buy in to all the "feel good" talk out there.

**Ready to Talk More?** When you're ready to Plus It, all it takes is a phone call to 417-213-1205 or send me an email at [ThadSTorix@gmail.com](mailto:thadstorix@gmail.com)
