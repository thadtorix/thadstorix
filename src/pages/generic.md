### In 2017, great friends of ours asked if I would be the minister for their wedding

in Kansas City, Missouri. Being no stranger to public speaking, and having always felt drawn to ministry, I was happy to help!

Turns out, it went really well and I thoroughly enjoyed serving in this fashion. Since then, several people have reached out to ask if I’d be interested in serving as the minister for their big day, and I love it!

If you’re planning a wedding in Southwest Missouri and would like my help as an officiant, please give me a call or text at 417-213-1205. If you’d prefer to email me at ThadSTorix@gmail.com that’s fine as well but you may want to shoot me a text to let me know the email is headed my way.

The information I will need from you includes:

What sort of wedding you are planning? (Traditional or something else?)

Where will the wedding take place? (address of the venue, or city/state)

Indoor or Outdoor?

A bit about what type of ceremony would you like? Simple? Traditional? Eloping?

You’ll find me to be thorough and clear in communication, and eager to make sure your special day is exactly as planned!

I work hard to be more than just some stranger in a suit going through the motions. This means I take the time to get to know you just a bit and make sure no detail is missed. Relationships with my clients are the key to my success and I look forward to helping make your day the best day ever!

#### Common Questions About Hiring Me As Your Minister:

Most messages I get are looking for more information about me, so I'm posting a more frequent response here:

My fee varies depending on location and what is desired.  To give you a quote, I'll need to know some basic info:

* Date
* Location (just the city/state is fine if you haven't decided on a venue just yet)
* If a wedding: Type of ceremony desired (traditional/simple, old fashioned, specific faith/doctrine desires, etc.)
* Any additional things from me (giving a message at rehearsal or reception dinners, special honoring ceremonies, etc.)

Send me the above info and I will send you an exact price.

All It takes to book is the non-refundable retainer of $100.  The remainder of the balance is not due until 7 days before the ceremony.  Some couples pay all at once, some pay over time with a few payments, and some wait until the week before the ceremony to square up.  I accept cards or checks.

I allow one change of date at no additional charge as long as I am not already booked for the date you are changing to. 

That's the basics, but I think people should know more about me, and what more I do:

The extras that are included in a traditional ceremony include:  

* My availability before during and after your big day.  Sometimes people get nervous or there's a conflict with their mate and they just need to chat with someone who is able to listen without being overly attached with one side or the other. I'm a professional encourager and am helpful in easing even the most extreme cases of nerves/anxiety/etc.
* I pray for you (obviously not a thing I charge for.... that'd just be weird.)  I spend time each morning in prayer for the couples who have trusted me with this role.  I'm not talking about religion and rules.  I'm talking about just praying for the well being of people and for a life full of happiness.
* I check in with the "Moms" (or whomever is most important to the couple), as often as needed.  I know that it's important to make sure Bride and Groom's Moms (or some version of Mom) are happy and that they know their adult children are happy.
* I help your photographer get the perfect shots.  Making sure your bridal party knows when to slow down and pause is super critical and many ministers miss this detail.  
* I help your bridal party know how to avoid passing out. Those moments are great for funny videos, but nobody wants that to happen in their wedding. I've been a paramedic my entire adult life, (over 20 years) which helps me help your bridal party stay standing for your ceremony!
* A special gift from me that you'll find useful in your marriage after the honeymoon phase has passed. (Couples rave about this gift and it has proven very helpful in all stages of marriage!)
* Perhaps most important:  I help (when asked) you write your vows.  When a bride/groom is having trouble coming up with what to say, it can be terrifying.  I'm great at getting people past writer's block.  
* Last, but not least, is my favorite moment in my work:  Just a bit before the ceremony, I find time with the Bride & Groom (either together or separately depending on your desire) to take a moment just before "go time".  In that moment I'll make sure you are all set and I'll pray with you.  I don't make it a big deal, just a quick and sincere prayer over each of you as you make the biggest promise of your life.  Many couples tell me later that this moment made a big difference, even when they aren't really used to religion or praying or whatever.
