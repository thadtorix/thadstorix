  {From 2009}\

  \

  I received a special treat this Valentine's day. As is often the case, I was
  taken by surprise by this blessing and was quite busy at the time.


  Working as a police officer today, I worked a two car accident in town. It’s
  really not important who’s fault the accident was. In fact, these kind of
  accidents happen often and are really just the result of folks being in a
  hurry.


  One of the cars was driven by an elderly woman, we’ll call her Valerie. The
  people that witnessed the accident were afraid that Valerie was injured. When
  I approach Valerie I notice two things immediately. First, she is the picture
  of the typical elderly woman. She might have weighed 90 pounds if she just
  happened to be carrying rocks in her pockets. Second, Valerie is obviously in
  pain.


  Before I attend to all the details of “working” the accident, I attend to
  Valerie, and it goes something like this:


  “Ma’am, where do you hurt?”


  “I’m fine, I must get to my husband.”


  “What do you mean? Is he hurt? Was he in the car with you?”


  “No. No. He’s at home. He’s been having trouble with his pace maker and he
  needs me there. I must get to him.”


  It takes me just a bit to realize that Valerie isn’t about to deal with her
  own needs until I can assure her that her husband, we’ll call him Raymond, is
  going to be taken care of. It takes some talking on my part, but I convince
  Valerie that she won’t be able to take care of Raymond until we know she’s
  okay. Valerie reluctantly allows the ambulance crew to care for her and take
  her on the hospital.


  Raymond and Valerie have just one car, and have recently moved to town. They
  have no family in town, but have vacationed here every year since the early
  1970s.


  I get what I need for my report. Tow Trucks and Taxi Cabs make sure the
  roadway is back to normal and I head for the hospital to talk with Valerie. As
  I’m leaving the accident scene, I remember Raymond. Raymond is still at home,
  unaware that his wife has been in an accident.


  Ordinarily, we don’t contact family after minor accidents. That sort of thing
  is ordinarily left for the hospital staff. Today I make an exception and call
  Raymond from my cell phone:


  “Is she alright?!”


  “She is awake and seems to be doing okay sir, but they’ll need to check her
  out. Do you have a way to the hospital?”


  “Oh, No. We just moved her, and don’t really have any friends in town. I’ll
  have to walk. I’d better get going!”


  The distance from their condo to the hospital would be a two hour walk for a
  man half Raymond’s age. “Sir, I’ll be there in five minutes. I’ll get you to
  the hospital.”


  Another thing we don’t ordinarily do is give folks a ride. Police cars aren’t
  taxi cabs after all, and if we’ve got a passenger, we’re not available to
  respond to other emergencies. But, we do make exceptions on certain occasions
  and this is one of them. To be honest, it never occurred to me not to give
  Raymond a ride.


  I throw my duty bag in the back, get Raymond situated in the front seat and
  we’re off. It’s a short trip to the hospital. We have long enough to talk
  about a few things, but Raymond is, of course, nervously distracted.


  When I asked Raymond how old he was (I know it’s rude, but some questions the
  police can get away with asking!) his answer was not what I expected. Instead
  of telling me how many years he’d been alive, he told me how many years they
  had been married, “Fifty-four years we’ve been married.”


  I’m able to re-assure Raymond that Valerie will be alright, but I know that he
  won’t rest easy until he’s seen her for himself.


  We arrive at the emergency room and I take Raymond to Valerie’s room, where
  seemingly she’s not hurt a bit. In fact, if not for the hospital gown and her
  sitting in a bed, you wouldn’t know she was a patient at all.


  In the next three seconds, I am blessed to observe fifty plus years of love
  expressed without a word. Smiles on both of their faces give way to tear
  filled eyes as they embrace. An instant later and both Valerie and Raymond
  seem as if there isn’t a thing wrong at all. Now certain that they still have
  each other, broken cars and hospital bills just aren’t such big problems.


  Both Raymond and Valerie insist on handshakes and hugs for me as they say
  thank-you for my help. I check with the nurse to be sure a taxi will be
  provided when it’s time to go home.


  I excuse myself and head back to the patrol car. I can’t help but appreciate
  what an honor I have been given in my life to be witness to this, and
  countless other moments in the lives of people I’ve been able to help along
  the way.
