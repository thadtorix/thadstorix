Recently, I flew across the country to attend my Brother's funeral. I may write about that some time in the future, but today I'd rather tell you about my trip.

At the mercy of another's frequent flyer miles, I found myself running from one gate to the next to make a connecting flight. I literally stepped into the cabin moments before they closed the door.

The large plane was packed, and I had been the guy holding it up. Not exactly popular, I headed for my seat next to the window, in the very last row.I arrived at row 99 (at least if felt like there were that many rows..) to find what many an air traveler would dread: two small children in the seats next to mine.

This is where the notable conversation begins; right after a smiling flight attendant whispers, "They've been waiting to see if they can have your window seat!"

"Of course they can!" I reply, immediately comparing this 11 year old and his younger sister to my own kids. Similar in age, with at least as much energy, these two get along about as well as my girls do.

We'll call them A.J. and Sarah. They were flying "un-accompanied," meaning one parent dropped them off in Memphis, while another will pick them up in Los Angeles.

As chatty as most kids their age, A.J. and Sarah are eager to tell me all about life as fellow grade-schoolers. Sarah recounts every step of a recent visit to Disney World, between interruptions from A.J., while she works diligently on Princess Aurora's evening gown in her favorite coloring book.

A.J. begins to tell me about his favorite cars. "The faster the better!" A.J.'s predictable philosophy on the topic.

On and on they go, sharing their dreams of becoming a doctor, a lawyer, or maybe even a police officer. They love pizza, M&Ms and staying up late. Loved by their family, they tell me about home and tell me how much they enjoy church.

The conversation turns a touch more serious when I ask more about home. A soft spoken Sarah tells me, "We're Mexican."

Shocked by her answer, I ask her again. This time, A.J. responds. "Other kids don't make fun of us.... if they think we're Mexican." He explains.

"We are Americans too." Sarah reminds me, "We were born in California!" Her eyes betray her words as she chokes back a tear.

You see, "A.J." and "Sarah" are actually Ajeet and Siah. Born and raised in California, their parents came to the United States with the same dream that carries you and I to work each day: To give their children more than they had.

I pause for a moment, as I notice a few other "grown ups" in the seats around us are now paying attention. Before I can respond to these two young Americans, they share a little more.

"My friends run around me in circles, chanting and screaming 'woo woo woo!' like Native Americans."

"The kids in my class ask me if my parents run a seven-eleven." Siah explains, making it clear she doesn't quite comprehend this particular insult.

The protector in me is quick to assure Siah and Ajeet that they are just as American as any of their classmates. Even more so, perhaps, as their immediate family is currently living the dream that our great land offers.

They seem to find some comfort in my encouragement and Ajeet offers one more story. "My father says, when 9/11 happened, he cried and cried for the people killed... but he was afraid to leave our home because people were mean to him."

I visit with Ajeet and Siah a bit longer before their eyes grow sleepy and they curl up beneath their blanket.

Our audience of travelers seems pleased with my words of encouragement as Brother and Sister drift off to sleep, our flight now half-over.

I can't help but wonder though, if I'm the only one on the plane examining his own heart. These two young American Kids taught me a lesson about myself nobody else has been able to.... I'm ugly.

Frustrated with the accent of the person answering my last call to customer service, I've mocked a man I've never met. A man who was just as frustrated as I was with our difficulty in communicating. I've laughed along with everyone else at the cruel jokes told about, "those people".

Ordinarily, implying I am a racist would be asking for a fight. Today, two little kids, American kids, have revealed a place in my life far overdue for change. 

Have I been a "textbook" racist? I suppose not, however, in the future, I believe I will measure such things against the hearts of little children such as Siah and Ajeet. Somehow, yesterday's jokes just aren't so funny anymore.

What about you? Are you speaking about or treating people differently because of the way they sound? The way they look? The faith they hold? I think most of us have from time to time. If you get the chance, have a good long chat with those folks' children and see if it doesn't make a difference.

It took two kids, the first two in their family to be born on American soil, to remind me: Hate is a terribly ugly and hurtful thing, regardless of how we may try to rationalize it.

Authors note:  Nearly a decade later, this story reminds me of the words of a good friend and fantastic professor, Diana Fordham: "You can't help but to judge a book by its cover.  You're human after all.  Just be sure to read the pages."
